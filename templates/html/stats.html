<li>{{ Browser Filter means that both the \"A\" and \"AAAA\" test failed.  Browser
(plugin/filter) shenanigans, likely with add-ons like ad blockers. }}</li>
<li>{{ Brokeness goes down, when volume goes up.   This is due to having a
wider sample of average people (versus people explicitly testing a new IPv6
setup). }}</li>
